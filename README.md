<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
Projects are used to organise tasks into logical units. Users can have one of the three roles: Administrator, Project Manager and Developer.
 A system for tracking Tasks and User assignments is administered by the Administrator, who is allowed to do any of the scenarios defined below.
Scenarios:

● All Users use the same login form.

● Administrator can view, create, modify and delete Projects, Tasks and Users. He can also assign / unassign a Task to a User.

● Project Managers can create Projects, Tasks and assign Tasks to the Developers.

● User can modify Task only if it is assigned to him / her. User with Developer role is allowed to change: status, progress, description. User with Project Manager role is allowed to change: assignee, status, progress, deadline,
description. User can view only tasks that are assigned to him / her or are not assigned to anyone.

● Project manager can view a list of projects and their progress. Project progress is based on progress
of all project tasks. (e.g. project with three tasks with progress 0%, 50% and 100% has progress 50%)
